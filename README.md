# webalizer_xlsx_parser
Downloads report pages from the webalizer program.


USAGE:
  Open the download.py module, it will prompt an http address to obtain the reports and the
path to a directory to save them.

  The xlsx_parser.py module will prompt for the path to the directory containing the downloaded
reports and another path for saving the xlsx file.


  This has only been tested on a single website and I never actually used the Webalizer, so it
may not work on every setup.
